# Responsive Admin Dashboard Design #02
In this tutorial ([Open in Youtube](https://youtu.be/D88K1esxwuo)),  I'm going to show you how to use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a completely responsive admin dashboard with light and dark mode theme functionality. We'll be using CSS Variables, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Media queries for our responsive design, and CSS  transitions and animations for some cool animation effects.
